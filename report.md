# Penetration Test Finding Report

## Finding ID: PT-2023-001

### Vulnerability Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Application: test.io

### Organization: Test Inc.

### Date of Discovery: [Insert Date]

### Severity Level: High

---

### 1. **Vulnerability Description**

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the web application hosted at test.io. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When a user accesses a compromised page, the malicious script executes within the context of the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and potentially perform actions on behalf of the user.

### 2. **Vulnerable Endpoint(s)**

- **Endpoint:** `https://test.io/search`
- **Parameter:** `query`

### 3. **Technical Details**

During the penetration test, the following steps were performed to identify the XSS vulnerability:

1. **Input Validation Bypass**: 
   - Input was provided to the `query` parameter in the search functionality with the following payload:
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS');</script>
     ```
  
2. **Response Analysis**:
   - The application returned the search results page with the injected script rendered as HTML without proper encoding or escaping. This indicates that user input is not sanitized before being reflected back into the web page.

3. **Demonstration of Impact**:
   - Upon executing the crafted request, the JavaScript alert was triggered, confirming that the payload was executed in the user's browser:
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS');</script>
     ```
   - This demonstrates the potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user session.

### 4. **Impact**

The presence of an XSS vulnerability poses significant risks, including but not limited to:

- Theft of session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions.
- Phishing attacks, where attackers can present fake login forms to users.
- Defacement of the web application or manipulation of the content presented to users.
- Distribution of malware through malicious scripts.

### 5. **Recommended Remediation**

- **Input Sanitization**: Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-generated content. Ensure that any data reflected back to the user is properly escaped or encoded, especially when rendering HTML content.
  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Consider implementing a strong Content Security Policy to help mitigate the risk of XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which scripts can be executed.

- **Testing**: Conduct thorough regression testing after applying the fix to ensure that the vulnerability is resolved and no new issues are introduced.

### 6. **Conclusion**

The presence of an XSS vulnerability in the test.io application represents a significant security risk that must be addressed promptly. By implementing the recommended remediation steps, Test Inc. can improve the security posture of their application and protect users from potential attacks.
