User and Access Management:
- User accounts are managed via Active Directory, with MFA enforced for all privileged accounts. 
- A PAM solution, CyberArk, is used for managing admin access.

Data Classification:
- Data is classified into three categories: Public, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. 
- Encryption is mandatory for all Highly Confidential data at rest and in transit.

Third-Party Integrations:
- The environment is integrated with AWS for cloud services and Office 365 for email and collaboration.

Incident History:
