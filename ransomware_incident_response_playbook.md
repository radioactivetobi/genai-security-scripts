### 1. Purpose
The purpose of this playbook is to establish a structured response to ransomware threats affecting the organization's key assets, including the ERP system, Active Directory, and customer databases. 

### 2. Scope
This playbook applies to all incidents involving ransomware attacks that potentially impact sensitive personal and financial information stored within our systems.

### 3. Incident Response Team Structure
- **Incident Response Lead**: Responsible for the overall incident management and decision-making.
- **IT Security Analyst**: Focused on investigation and technical analysis.
- **System Administrator**: Manages affected systems and recovery efforts.
- **Legal and Compliance Officer**: Ensures compliance with regulations and laws.
- **Communications Officer**: Manages communication with stakeholders, including customers and media.

### 4. Preparation
- **Training**: Conduct regular training sessions for the incident response team on ransomware threats.
- **Tools**: Ensure availability of forensic tools (e.g., EnCase, FTK) and malware analysis tools.
- **Backup**: Implement a robust backup strategy with regular testing, ensuring backups are offline and immutable.
- **Policy Updates**: Review and update security policies and incident response plans annually.

### 5. Detection and Identification
- **Monitoring Systems**: Utilize SIEM tools to monitor logs for unusual activity.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Look for known IoCs associated with ransomware (e.g., unusual file extensions, ransom notes).
- **User Reports**: Encourage users to report any suspicious activity or system behavior.

#### Actions:
1. Confirm the presence of ransomware through analysis of affected systems.
2. Identify the type of ransomware (if possible) and its propagation method.

### 6. Containment
- **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
- **Controlled Shutdown**: If necessary, perform a controlled shutdown of critical systems (ERP, Active Directory) to minimize damage.
- **Determine Scope**: Assess which systems are affected and prioritize based on criticality.

#### Actions:
1. Implement segmentation controls to isolate infected systems.
2. Disable user accounts that may have been compromised.

### 7. Eradication
- **Threat Removal**: Utilize antivirus and anti-malware tools to remove the ransomware from infected systems.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities that allowed the ransomware to infect systems.
- **System Restoration**: Ensure that all systems are restored from clean backups.

#### Actions:
1. Conduct a forensic analysis of affected systems to understand the attack vector.
2. Review and update security configurations across systems.

### 8. Recovery
- **System Restoration**: Restore systems from verified backups, ensuring they are free of ransomware.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of restored systems for any signs of re-infection.
- **Validation**: Conduct thorough testing of systems to ensure functionality and security before reintroduction to the network.

#### Actions:
1. Communicate with affected users about the status and expected recovery timelines.
2. Reintroduce systems to the network in a phased manner.

### 9. Post-Incident Review
- **Incident Report**: Document the incident, including timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis to determine the root cause and prevent future occurrences.
- **Policy Review**: Update incident response policies based on findings from the incident.

#### Actions:
1. Schedule a debriefing with the incident response team and key stakeholders.
2. Share insights and recommendations with the broader organization.

### 10. Communication Plan
- **Internal Communication**: Keep all stakeholders informed throughout the incident, including updates on containment and recovery efforts.
- **External Communication**: Prepare statements for customers and media as necessary, ensuring transparency while protecting sensitive information.

#### Actions:
1. Use pre-approved communication templates for rapid response.
2. Coordinate with legal counsel for compliance with data breach notification laws.

### 11. Additional Resources
- **Ransomware Playbooks**: Review relevant ransomware-specific resources and frameworks (e.g., NIST, SANS).
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Subscribe to threat intelligence services for real-time updates on ransomware threats.
- **Cyber Insurance**: Ensure that cyber insurance policies are in place to cover potential losses from ransomware incidents.
