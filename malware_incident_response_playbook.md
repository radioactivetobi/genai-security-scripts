# Incident Response Playbook

## Threat Type: malware

Creating a detailed incident response playbook for handling a malware threat is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC). Below is a comprehensive playbook that outlines the steps to take when a malware incident is detected in your environment. This playbook is structured around the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide and follows a typical incident response lifecycle: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.

# Incident Response Playbook: Malware Threat

## 1. Preparation

### 1.1 Policies and Procedures
- Establish and maintain an incident response policy that outlines roles, responsibilities, and authority.
- Define malware types relevant to your organization (e.g., ransomware, trojans, spyware, etc.).
- Ensure all team members are trained on the incident response process.

### 1.2 Tools and Resources
- Ensure availability of necessary tools: EDR solutions, antivirus, forensic tools, SIEM, and logging mechanisms.
- Maintain an up-to-date inventory of hardware and software assets.
- Establish a communication plan for internal and external stakeholders.

### 1.3 Incident Response Team
- Assign roles within the incident response team (manager, analysts, forensic investigator, communications officer, etc.).
- Conduct regular training and tabletop exercises.

## 2. Detection and Analysis

### 2.1 Detection
- Monitor for indicators of compromise (IoCs) using SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR solutions.
- Utilize threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on emerging malware threats.
- Review alerts and logs for suspicious behavior (e.g., unusual file modifications, abnormal network traffic).

### 2.2 Initial Analysis
- Confirm the malware alert by conducting a preliminary investigation.
- Identify affected systems and the scope of the incident (e.g., number of devices, user accounts).
- Gather relevant information: timestamps, file hashes, user activity logs, and network connections.

### 2.3 Classification
- Classify the malware type and its potential impact on the organization.
- Determine the malware variant using threat intelligence sources and malware analysis tools.

## 3. Containment

### 3.1 Short-term Containment
- Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread (disconnect from the internet and internal network).
- Disable user accounts if necessary.

### 3.2 Long-term Containment
- Apply temporary fixes to prevent malware from spreading while preparing for eradication.
- Ensure that the containment measures do not disrupt critical business operations.

## 4. Eradication

### 4.1 Identify the Root Cause
- Investigate how the malware infiltrated the environment (e.g., phishing emails, unpatched vulnerabilities).
- Document the attack vector for future reference and prevention.

### 4.2 Remove the Malware
- Use antivirus/anti-malware tools to clean affected systems.
- Manually remove malicious files and registry entries if necessary.
- Apply patches and updates to address vulnerabilities that were exploited.

## 5. Recovery

### 5.1 Restore Systems
- Rebuild compromised systems from known good backups.
- Ensure that systems are fully patched and updated before reconnecting to the network.

### 5.2 Monitor for Recurrence
- Implement additional monitoring on restored systems to detect any signs of reinfection.
- Conduct regular scans and audits to ensure no remnants of the malware remain.

## 6. Post-Incident Activity

### 6.1 Documentation
- Document all actions taken during the incident response process, including timelines, decisions, and communications.
- Create an incident report that outlines the incident details, response actions, and lessons learned.

### 6.2 Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review with the incident response team and relevant stakeholders.
- Discuss what went well, what could be improved, and update the incident response plan accordingly.

### 6.3 Training and Awareness
- Share findings with the broader organization to enhance awareness of malware threats.
- Provide training to employees on recognizing phishing attempts and safe browsing practices.

### 6.4 Update Security Measures
- Review and strengthen security measures based on the incident's findings (e.g., enhanced email filtering, endpoint security improvements).
- Consider investing in additional security technologies or services if needed.

## Conclusion

This incident response playbook provides a structured approach to handling malware threats in your environment. It is vital to routinely review and update the playbook to adapt to evolving threats and changes in your organizational environment. Regular training and awareness programs will also help in minimizing the risk of malware incidents.
